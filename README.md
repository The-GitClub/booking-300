# booking-300
We developed an application that could be used by a  restaurant to improve the flow of their booking process. 
Using our application, all bookings for a restaurant would be centralised within the application whether a booking is created online by a customer or by a staff member of the restaurant. 
Users must register and log in to the application to access functionality. 
We implemented different typesÂ of users: Customers, Staff, Managers

STAFF LOGIN: staff@gmaiil.com

STAFF PASSWORD: staff123

MANAGER LOGIN: manager@gmail.com

MANAGER PASSWORD: manager123
